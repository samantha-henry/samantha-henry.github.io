I am interested in organismal biology, evolution, conservation, and behavior.

I received my Associate of Arts degree at Valencia College (2019-2021), where I
focused on Biology.

Then I received my Bachelor of Science in Biology at the University of Central
Florida (2021-2023), where I focused on Zoology and Pre-Veterinary Science.
